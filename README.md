## Project Overview

A headless CMS for managing and delivering content via API, built with the following technologies:

- [**Axum**](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum): A web framework for building robust and scalable web applications.
- [**SeaORM**](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm): An async ORM built on top of sqlx for interacting with databases.
- [**Utoipa**](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa): Documentation and specification for APIs.
- **OpenTelemetry**: Observability tools for monitoring and tracing.

## Usage

Change the database url in the [flake.nix](./flake.nix) or update it in the `.env` if you are not using Nix.

If you want to use Postgres, update the database URL and enable the `sqlx-postgres` feature on the `sea-orm` dependency.

Configurations are loaded in the [config.rs](./src/config.rs) and share across the app.

Can collect the traces simply with [otel-desktop-viewer](https://github.com/CtrlSpice/otel-desktop-viewer).
